These rules apply to manually posting killmails.

- Do not modify killmails.
- Do not post killmails from Singularity (Or any other server than Tranquility)
- Do not post fake killmails, even if they are meant as a joke.

Failure to adhere to these simple rules, will result in losing killmail posting privileges, and in worst case, a ban from the entire site.
